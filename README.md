# learn_cv_tut

Repository for learning OpenCV library in c++, to study for work.

I think using Matlab to do image processing so far at work has been amazing, except for the run speed of it. In the past tried to optimize this run speed by exporting Matlab to mex or c/c++ and tweaking it from there. But I think this approach is wrong.

Since you can integrate native c/c++ code to Matlab anyways, why not go start form c++ and then integrate to Matlab where my coworkers then can pick it up in Matlab dev environment ?

So this git repo will keep my study notes.
